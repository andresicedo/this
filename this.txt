What do I know about "this"?
"This" allows us to reuse functions with different context or in other words, 
allows us to decide which objects should be focal when calling a function or 
a method.

First question to ask when trying to identify "this".
"Where is the function being called?" 
In order to know what "this" is referencing, you have to know where the 
function is being called.

There are four ways we can use "this".
Implicit Binding, Explicit Binding, New Binding and Window Binding

Implicit Binding: This is the most common occurrence of "this". When you call 
a function, look a the left of the "." and that is what the "this" keyword is 
referencing. Summary: When this is being used, go to the where the function is 
being called, look the left of the "." .

Explicit Binding: Explicitly stating what "this" is. We can do this using 
three methods: call, apply and bind.

New Binding: "new" keyword, when used, has javascript create a brand new object. 
"this" keyword inside the function is bound to the new object being constructed.

Window Binding: if Implicit, Explicit or New Binding are not present, "this" 
will point to the window object.
